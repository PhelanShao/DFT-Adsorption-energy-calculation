The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional in generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange correlation functionals was used in the geometry optimization and single point energy calculations. 
The dispersion was corrected by the Grimme scheme to avoid the limitations in handling weak interactions by DFT. 
Double numerical plus polarization basis set (DNP) was used for the geometry optimization tasks and energy calculations.
DFT Semi-Core Pseudopots (DSPP) was used to describe the core electrons. The global orbital cutoff value was set to 5.0 angstrom. 
The COSMO solvent model of pure water (dielectric constant=78.54) was applied to simulate an actual solvent environment.
The setting values of the convergence thresholds for energy change, maximum force, maximum displacement and the threshold for SCF density convergence were specified for 1.0×10-5 Ha, 0.002 Ha/Å, 0.005 Å and 1.0×10-5, respectively. 
The modelling of the Cd nano-chain slices is shown in FigureS7.
In order to ensure that the balance of the adsorption energy calculation makes the comparison meaningful, only one of the Cd atoms in the Cd nano-chain slices (the one closer to the carbon surface) was kept surface charged.
